The fast moving gas in the black holes tend to create friction, making the galaxies look brighter than the other galaxies surrounding them. These galaxies with more brightness can appear as if they have more stars. When these bright galaxies are removed it is more easier for scientists to fit early galaxies in a model."

In the region that we live in the universe, opposing things tends to have more opposing forces which slows down the formation of stars. But, in theory, ancient universe was denser than today, it is harder to blow gas away which makes it easier to form stars."

The scientists, now knowing that blackhole also contributes to the brightness of the galaxies, needs to differentiate whether the light is coming from the blackhole or the stars."

It is extremely near its star at the distance of 1/20th compared to the Earth and Sun. This allows WASP-96 b to fully orbit the star in 3.5 days. The planet was discovered through ground-based observations in 2014. Its host star, WASP-96, is similar in size, mass, temperature, and colour to the Sun, but a little older."
